This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js. The problem arises when a component uses a dynamic class name generated based on props or state.  If this dynamic class includes a Tailwind class that doesn't exist, Tailwind's purge mechanism might remove it, leading to the class not being applied. This results in unexpected styling or the absence of expected styling. For example, imagine a component that generates the class `bg-${color}` where `color` is a prop. If a value for `color` is passed which is not defined in your `tailwind.config.js` file then this class might not be applied.

```javascript
// Component
function MyComponent({ color }) {
  return <div className={`bg-${color} p-4`}>Content</div>;
}
```
